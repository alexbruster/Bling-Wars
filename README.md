Game made with React.

The app will connect to SWAPI (The Star Wars API, https://swapi.co/documentation) and randomly select two players and two space vehicles between the characters and their ships. A load to be transported and a distance to be travelled with it is also randomly selected. The game
is won by the player who does it in a shorter time, based on the characteristics of the load and the speed of the vehicles.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
